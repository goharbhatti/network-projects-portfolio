# Campus Area Network Design & Implementation (Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates the complete design and implementation of a Campus Area Network (CAN) using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, based on the ‚ÄúComplete CAN Design ‚Äì Part 1 & 2‚Äù series. It replicates an enterprise-grade network with hierarchical architecture, VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, ACLs, and ASA-based firewall protection.

|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Tool Used              | Cisco Packet Tracer                                    |
| Architecture           | 3-tier (Core, Distribution, Access)                    |
| VLAN Segmentation      | For separate departments (Admin, HR, IT, etc.)         |
| Inter-VLAN Routing     | Done via Layer 3 Switch                                |
| DHCP                   | Centralized DHCP setup for multiple VLANs              |
| ACLs                   | Standard & Extended ACLs for filtering                 |
| Firewall               | Cisco ASA simulation for edge protection               |
| NAT & VPN              | PAT and Site-to-Site VPN implementation (optional)     |
