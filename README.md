# Networking Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of networking projects I‚Äôve completed after obtaining my CCNA certification. These labs demonstrate real-world networking scenarios and cover routing, switching, NAT, ACLs, VPNs, DHCP, and basic network automation using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, and Python.

## üîß Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- GNS3
- Wireshark
- Putty
- Cisco CLI
- Python (Netmiko, Paramiko)
